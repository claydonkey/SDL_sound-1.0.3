These project files were built with CodeWarrior Pro 5.3, but should work withCWPro 5.0 or later. Requires:You should have the Universal Headers & Interfaces 3.4 or later installed.You must get the SDL headers and copy them (or alias them) in the include/SDL directory.Files:sdl_sound.mcp     - CodeWarrior 5 project filesdl_sound.mcp.exp - symbols that are exported in stub lib and dll    If symbols are missing i.e. you have link problems:    1. Remove the .exp file (trash it).    2. Clean and rebuild shared lib.    3. Open the new .exp file, remove symbols you don't want to export, and save.    4. Rebuild shared lib and stub lib.   sdl_sound.prefix.h - compile optionssdl_sound.shlib.r  - version resource and finder balloon infoOutput:SDL_sound  - shared library. Put this in application directory or extensions folder (other locations possible).SDL_sound.LIB  - static library. Link with this to debug SDL Mixer since you can't debug shared libraries in CodeWarrior.SDL_sound.STUB - stub link library. Link with this if you are using the shared library.Notes:For the shared lib, the .exp file governs what symbols will be available to whomever links to the dll or stub lib.Not compiled:Timidity is not included for now, should be easy to patch in.MP3 playback is not available, would require port of SMPEG.OGG is not available.Problems?Please contact me if there are any problems or suggestions: <dwaliss1@purdue.edu>
