	The purpose of this directory is to include the MPW C library headersso that we can build a library with CodeWarrior that does notrequire linking to Metrowerk's Standard C Library. This saves usabout 100k from the shared library.	I built this directory by first taking the difference of the Universal Headers 3.4 and the Headers from MPW. Then I added theheaders one by one until everything compiled, so this is theminimum set of headers required. I also added an emptystdint.h, which is not in MPW, for compatibility with UH 3.4.-DW
